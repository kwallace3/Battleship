# Description
## What?
Our **server-client Battleship Game** allows two players to virtually play a competitive game of Battleship.
## Why?
Battleship is a cool game to design for a project. It is challenging to build a game server and clients. This project would help us learn and review the concept of Network programming especially socket-programming.
## How?
Users will be able to connect to our game server and load a graphic user interface, they will also be connected to a player.
## Deliverables
1. Tkinter - Python's GUI package
2. Socket-programming - client and server
3. Github
4. Threading
5. Documentation
